# Explanation:
# 1. Intuition:
#    The matrix is sorted in a way that allows us to treat it as a single sorted array.
#    We can apply binary search on this virtual sorted array to find the target value.
# 2. Time and space complexity:
#    - Time complexity: O(log(m * n)), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
#      This is because we are performing binary search on the virtual sorted array of size m * n.
#    - Space complexity: O(1), as we are only using a few constant extra variables.
# 3. Important considerations:
#    - The matrix must be sorted in non-decreasing order in each row, and the first integer of each row
#      must be greater than the last integer of the previous row.
#    - The code handles the case where the matrix is empty or has no columns.
#    - The code calculates the row and column indices from the middle index using division and modulo operations.
