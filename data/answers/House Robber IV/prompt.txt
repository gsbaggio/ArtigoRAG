CURRENT QUESTION:
There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.

The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the ith house from the left has nums[i] dollars.

You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.

Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k houses.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0], nums[4]) = 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2

Title: House Robber III
Categorys: Dynamic Programming Tree Depth-First Search Binary Tree
Question text: The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 104
Solution: public int rob(TreeNode root) {
    int[] res = robSub(root);
    return Math.max(res[0], res[1]);
}

private int[] robSub(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return new int[2];
    
    int[] left = robSub(root.left);
    int[] right = robSub(root.right);
    int[] res = new int[2];

    res[0] = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]);
    res[1] = root.val + left[0] + right[0];
    
    return res;
}
Explanation: In step I, we defined our problem as rob(root), which will yield the maximum amount of money that can be robbed of the binary tree rooted at root. This leads to the DP problem summarized in step II.

Now let's take one step back and ask why we have overlapping subproblems. If you trace all the way back to the beginning, you'll find the answer lies in the way how we have defined rob(root). As I mentioned, for each tree root, there are two scenarios: it is robbed or is not. rob(root) does not distinguish between these two cases, so "information is lost as the recursion goes deeper and deeper", which results in repeated subproblems.

If we were able to maintain the information about the two scenarios for each tree root, let's see how it plays out. Redefine rob(root) as a new function which will return an array of two elements, the first element of which denotes the maximum amount of money that can be robbed if root is not robbed, while the second element signifies the maximum amount of money robbed if it is robbed.

Let's relate rob(root) to rob(root.left) and rob(root.right)..., etc. For the 1st element of rob(root), we only need to sum up the larger elements of rob(root.left) and rob(root.right), respectively, since root is not robbed and we are free to rob its left and right subtrees. For the 2nd element of rob(root), however, we only need to add up the 1st elements of rob(root.left) and rob(root.right), respectively, plus the value robbed from root itself, since in this case it's guaranteed that we cannot rob the nodes of root.left and root.right.

As you can see, by keeping track of the information of both scenarios, we decoupled the subproblems and the solution essentially boiled down to a greedy one. Here is the program:
