# Explanation:
# The problem asks us to find the minimum capability required to rob at least k houses.
# The capability is defined as the maximum amount of money stolen from any of the robbed houses.
# We can use binary search to find the minimum capability.
# The lower bound of the binary search is the minimum amount of money in any house, and the upper bound is the maximum amount of money in any house.
# For each capability value, we can check if it is possible to rob at least k houses with that capability.
# If it is possible, we can try a smaller capability value. Otherwise, we need to try a larger capability value.
# The time complexity of the binary search is O(log(max(nums) - min(nums))).
# The time complexity of the is_possible function is O(n), where n is the number of houses.
# Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * log(max(nums) - min(nums))).
# The space complexity is O(1).
#
# Important considerations:
# 1. The robber cannot steal from adjacent houses.
# 2. The robber must steal from at least k houses.
# 3. The capability is the maximum amount of money stolen from any of the robbed houses.
# 4. We need to find the minimum capability.
