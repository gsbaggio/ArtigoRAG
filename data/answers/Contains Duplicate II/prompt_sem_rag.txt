CURRENT QUESTION:
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= k <= 105


        INSTRUCTIONS:
        Solve the current question.
        Provide:
        1. A complete and efficient code solution, optimized for both time and space complexity.
        2. A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
           - The intuition behind the approach;
           - Time and space complexity;
           - Important considerations about the algorithm.
        3. If the language has classes, implement in 'Solution' class. Any language is accepted.
        4. Don't use any external libraries. Don't need to import any libraries.
