CURRENT QUESTION:
You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.

Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first.
Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier.
After the k operations, apply modulo 109 + 7 to every value in nums.

Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations and then applying the modulo.

    }
};
Explanation: Intuition
The general idea is to divide the operations greedily among all indexes.

Every number after getting an operation should not remain as the smallest. So we will have to achieve that state first.

BY OBSERVATION
When all the elements get atleast an operation, we will achieve the above mentioned state. So we will first greedily assign them operation till all elements get atleast one operation.

Use priority queue min heap or multiset for that.

After this we can assign every index a number of operations through our initial general idea.

What about such large value of k?
The number of operations of each index may be huge due to this. The optimal approach is achieved in log(n) as the multiplier increases exponentially. Check out the function in the code. This is called Exponentiation by Squaring.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(nlogk)

Space complexity: O(n)

Title: Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations
Categorys: Array Greedy Sorting
Question text: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, modify the array in the following way:

choose an index i and replace nums[i] with -nums[i].
You should apply this process exactly k times. You may choose the same index i multiple times.

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,3], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose index 1 and nums becomes [4,-2,3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and nums becomes [3,1,0,2].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and nums becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].

Explanation: 1- sort the numbers in ascending order
2- flip all the negative numbers, as long as k > 0
3- find the sum of the new array (with flipped numbers if any) and keep track of the minimum number
4- Now for the return statement
