/*
Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the number of unique XOR triplet values from all possible triplets (i, j, k) in the input array `nums`, where i <= j <= k.

Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to iterate through all possible triplets (i, j, k) that satisfy the condition i <= j <= k, calculate the XOR sum of the elements at these indices (nums[i] ^ nums[j] ^ nums[k]), and store the XOR sums in a set to keep track of the unique values.  Finally, the size of the set will give us the number of unique XOR triplet values.

Time and Space Complexity:

- Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we have three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets.
- Space Complexity: O(U), where U is the number of unique XOR triplet values. In the worst case, where all XOR triplet values are unique, the space complexity could be O(n^3). However, given the constraints (1 <= nums.length <= 1500, 1 <= nums[i] <= 1500), the number of unique XOR values is likely to be much smaller than n^3 in practice.  We use an unordered_set to store the unique XOR values, which provides average O(1) insertion and lookup times.

Important Considerations:

- The constraint i <= j <= k is crucial. It ensures that we only consider triplets in non-decreasing order of indices.
- The use of an unordered_set is important for efficiently tracking unique XOR values.  It avoids duplicate counting and provides fast lookups.
- The problem constraints (1 <= nums.length <= 1500, 1 <= nums[i] <= 1500) suggest that an O(n^3) solution is acceptable, as n is relatively small.  If the constraints were larger, we would need to explore more optimized approaches.
