CURRENT QUESTION:
You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.

Return the maximum valued number you can get.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 2736
Output: 7236
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.
Example 2:

Input: num = 9973
Output: 9973
Explanation: No swap.
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 108


        INSTRUCTIONS:
        Solve the current question.
        Provide:
        1. A complete and efficient code solution, optimized for both time and space complexity.
        2. A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
           - The intuition behind the approach;
           - Time and space complexity;
           - Important considerations about the algorithm.
        3. If the language has classes, implement in 'Solution' class. Any language is accepted.
