CURRENT QUESTION:
A k x k magic square is a k x k grid filled with integers such that every row sum, every column sum, and both diagonal sums are all equal. The integers in the magic square do not have to be distinct. Every 1 x 1 grid is trivially a magic square.

Given an m x n integer grid, return the size (i.e., the side length k) of the largest magic square that can be found within this grid.

 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[7,1,4,5,6],[2,5,1,6,4],[1,5,4,3,2],[1,2,7,3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The largest magic square has a size of 3.
Every row sum, column sum, and diagonal sum of this magic square is equal to 12.
- Row sums: 5+1+6 = 5+4+3 = 2+7+3 = 12
- Column sums: 5+5+2 = 1+4+7 = 6+3+3 = 12
- Diagonal sums: 5+4+3 = 6+4+2 = 12
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[5,1,3,1],[9,3,3,1],[1,3,3,8]]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 106

Question text: A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a row x col grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 magic square subgrids are there?

Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, grid may contain numbers up to 15.

Explanation: Intuition
In Approach 1, we determined whether each subarray of grid is a magic square by explicitly checking each criterion of the magic square definition given in the problem statement.

We can dive deeper into the definition of a 3 x 3 magic square to find additional properties that can help us simplify the logic for determining if a subarray is a magic square:

Constant Sum

By definition, every row has the same sum S. Furthermore, the definition states that a magic grid can only contain values 1 to 9 and each value must be distinct. Since every 3 x 3 magic grid will contain exactly 9 squares, we can see that every magic grid will have exactly one of each allowed value. Thus, we can see that the total sum of an entire 3 x 3 magic square is 1+2+3+...+9=45.

Because each magic square consists of 3 rows, we can say that 3S=45 and thus S=15. This means that every row sum, and in turn every column sum and diagonal sum, equals 15.

Limited Number of Arrangements

If every row, column, and diagonal has to sum up to 15 and can only contain distinct values from 1 to 9, then there are only a limited number of arrangements to form a magic square. Listed below are all possible combinations of 3-part sums that add up to 15, where each value is between 1 and 9:

1+5+9

1+6+8

2+4+9

2+5+8

2+6+7

3+4+8

3+5+7

4+5+6

We can see that there are 8 different ways, which map directly to the 8 3-part sums in the magic square (3 rows + 3 columns + 2 diagonals = 8 total sums). We can explore further constraints on arranging the possible magic squares.

Constraint 1 - Middle element

5 appears in exactly 4 of these sums. The only element that would appear in 4 sums is the middle element of the magic square. Specifically, the middle element appears in the sums for the middle row, the middle column, and both diagonals. Thus, we know that for a subarray to be a magic square, its middle element has to be 5.
Constraint 2 - Even numbers

Moreover, the even numbers (2, 4, 6, and 8) each appear in exactly 3 of the sums. Only the corner elements of the grid can appear in exactly 3 sums. Specifically, they appear in the sum for one row, one column, and one diagonal. Thus, we know the corner elements have to be even numbers.
Constraint 3 - Odd numbers

Finally, the only numbers remaining are the odd numbers (1, 3, 7, and 9). They each appear in exactly 2 of the sums. The remaining elements on the edges of the grid also appear in exactly 2 sums: the sums for one row and one column. Thus, we know the remaining edge elements have to be odd numbers.
We observe that for all possible arrangements, the elements around the border (the even/odd numbers from constraints 2/3 above) all follow the ordered sequence

2,9,4,3,8,1,6,7

either moving clockwise or counter-clockwise around the border, starting at a corner element.

Thus, we know that a subarray is a magic square if and only if it satisfies the 2 following properties:

The middle element is 5
The bordering elements follow the 2,9,4,3,8,1,6,7 sequence, starting at some corner element and going either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
