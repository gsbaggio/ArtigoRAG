CURRENT QUESTION:
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690


        INSTRUCTIONS:
        Solve the current question.
        Provide:
        1. A complete and efficient code solution, optimized for both time and space complexity.
        2. A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
           - The intuition behind the approach;
           - Time and space complexity;
           - Important considerations about the algorithm.
        3. If the language has classes, implement in 'Solution' class. Any language is accepted.
        4. Don't use any external libraries. Don't need to import any libraries.
