CURRENT QUESTION:
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.

For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

 

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
Explanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.
Example 3:
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
 

Constraints:

2 <= numCourses <= 100
0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= numCourses - 1
ai != bi
All the pairs [ai, bi] are unique.
The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
1 <= queries.length <= 104
0 <= ui, vi <= numCourses - 1
ui != vi

Question text: There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
Example 3:

Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
ai != bi
All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.
Solution: from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution(object):
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degree = [0] * numCourses

        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(course)
            in_degree[course] += 1

        queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if in_degree[i] == 0])
        result = []

        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            result.append(current)

            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return result if len(result) == numCourses else []
Explanation: Intuition
When scheduling courses with prerequisites, we can represent the problem as a Directed Graph. Each course is a node, and an edge from A â†’ B means you must take A before B. To find a valid order to take all courses, we perform topological sorting.

Approach
We use Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based topological sort):

Build a graph and track the in-degree of each course.
Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0).
Iteratively process these and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.
If all courses are added to the result, a valid schedule exists; otherwise, there is a cycle.
Complexity
Time complexity: (O(V + E)), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites
Space complexity: (O(V + E)) for the graph and queue

Question text: You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei. Also, you are given the integer k.

In one semester, you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semesters for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, relations = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 2 and 3.
In the second semester, you can take course 1.
In the third semester, you can take course 4.
Example 2:
Input: n = 5, relations = [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[1,5]], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can only take courses 2 and 3 since you cannot take more than two per semester.
In the second semester, you can take course 4.
In the third semester, you can take course 1.
In the fourth semester, you can take course 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= n
0 <= relations.length <= n * (n-1) / 2
relations[i].length == 2
1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n
prevCoursei != nextCoursei
All the pairs [prevCoursei, nextCoursei] are unique.
The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.

Explanation: Data Structures

We need to know the layout of the graph, who points to what. Let's keep a structure like graph = {node: [children]}
We also need to encode the information of how may in-edges are there for each node. We store that in a list like: in_degrees = [values]. We keep the in_degrees and graph separate for implementation reasons.
Implementation detail: the inputs are 1 indexed, we make everything 0-indexed for easier implementations.
Nodes
There are two types of nodes:

There are nodes which have been already considered. Let's label them with 0.
There are nodes which have not been taken yet. Let's label them with 1.
Note that even if a node is marked 1, it does not mean its in_degree[node] is 0. It only means it needs to be taken - either in the present or in the future.

Moreover, labelling a node either 0 or 1 allows us to represent the status of the problem in a neat format. What we have done here is called bit masking. mask = 10110 represents the nodes 1, 2, 4 are yet to be considered (aka the course is yet to be taken), and the rest have already been taken.

Recursion
We know that decisions taken now can produce different results later on. This makes the recursive approach favourable. For each particular iteration, we consider all the possible combinations of the currently available nodes - in_degree[node] == 0 and mask & 1 << node. The second part is checking if the nodeth bit is set in mask.
