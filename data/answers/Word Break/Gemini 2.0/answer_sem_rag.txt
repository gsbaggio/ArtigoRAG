class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: list[str]) -> bool:
        """
        Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

        Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
        Output: true
        Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
        Output: true
        Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
        Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
        Example 3:

        Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
        Output: false

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 300
        1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
        1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
        s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
        All the strings of wordDict are unique.

        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: an empty string can be segmented

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for word in wordDict:
                if i >= len(word) and s[i - len(word):i] == word:
                    dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[i - len(word)]

        return dp[n]

# Explanation:
# 1. Intuition:
#    - We use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
#    - dp[i] represents whether the substring s[0:i] can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
#    - The base case is dp[0] = True, which means an empty string can be segmented.
#    - For each i from 1 to n, we iterate through the words in the dictionary.
#    - If the current word is a suffix of s[0:i] and dp[i - len(word)] is True, then dp[i] is True.
#
# 2. Time and space complexity:
#    - Time complexity: O(n * m * k), where n is the length of s, m is the number of words in wordDict, and k is the average length of the words in wordDict.
#    - Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of s.
#
# 3. Important considerations:
#    - The order of the words in the dictionary does not matter.
#    - The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
#    - The algorithm can be optimized by using a set to store the words in the dictionary, which reduces the time complexity to O(n * m), where n is the length of s and m is the number of words in wordDict.
