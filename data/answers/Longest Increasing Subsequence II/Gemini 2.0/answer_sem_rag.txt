# Explanation:
# 1. Intuition:
#    - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
#    - We can build a dp array where dp[i] stores the length of the longest subsequence ending at nums[i].
#    - For each element nums[i], we iterate through all previous elements nums[j] (where j < i).
#    - If nums[i] is greater than nums[j] and the difference between them is at most k, then we can potentially extend the subsequence ending at nums[j] by adding nums[i].
#    - We update dp[i] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[j] + 1.
#    - Finally, the maximum value in the dp array will be the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements.

# 2. Time and Space Complexity:
#    - Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because we have two nested loops.
#    - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because we use a dp array of size n to store the lengths of the longest subsequences.

# 3. Important Considerations:
#    - The problem requires finding a strictly increasing subsequence with a maximum difference of k between adjacent elements.
#    - The dynamic programming approach allows us to efficiently explore all possible subsequences and find the longest one that meets the requirements.
#    - The base case for the dp array is that each element can form a subsequence of length 1 by itself.
#    - The algorithm iterates through the array and updates the dp array based on the conditions specified in the problem.
#    - The maximum value in the dp array represents the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements.
