# Explanation:
# 1. Intuition:
#    The core idea is to sort the array and then interleave the smaller and larger elements.
#    By placing smaller and larger elements next to each other, we ensure that the average
#    of the neighbors will not be equal to the element in the middle.
#    For example, if we have a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we can rearrange it as
#    [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. In this arrangement, each element is different from the average of its neighbors.
#
# 2. Time and Space Complexity:
#    - Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. The rest of the operations take O(n) time.
#    - Space Complexity: O(n) because we create a new array `result` to store the rearranged elements.
#
# 3. Important Considerations:
#    - The input array `nums` contains distinct integers. This is important because if there were duplicate
#      numbers, this approach might not work.
#    - The length of the array is at least 3. This is also important because the condition to check the average
#      of neighbors requires at least 3 elements.
#    - The problem asks for *any* rearrangement that meets the requirements. There might be multiple valid
#      rearrangements, and this algorithm provides one such rearrangement.
