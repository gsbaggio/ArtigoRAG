CURRENT QUESTION:
You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 20
0 <= nums[i] <= 107

Question text: In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
Example 2:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20
0 <= desiredTotal <= 300

            # uh-oh if we got here then next player won all permutations, we can't force their hand
            # actually, they were able to force our hand :(
            seen[seen_key] = False
            return False

        # let's do some quick checks before we journey through the tree of permutations
        summed_choices = (maxChoosableInteger + 1) * maxChoosableInteger / 2

        # if all the choices added up are less then the total, no-one can win
        if summed_choices < desiredTotal:
            return False

        # if the sum matches desiredTotal exactly then you win if there's an odd number of turns
        if summed_choices == desiredTotal:
		    return maxChoosableInteger % 2

        # slow: time to go through the tree of permutations
		choices = list(range(1, maxChoosableInteger + 1))
        return can_win(choices, desiredTotal)

Explanation: After solving several "Game Playing" questions in leetcode, I find them to be pretty similar. Most of them can be solved using the top-down DP approach, which "brute-forcely" simulates every possible state of the game.

The key part for the top-down dp strategy is that we need to avoid repeatedly solving sub-problems. Instead, we should use some strategy to "remember" the outcome of sub-problems. Then when we see them again, we instantly know their result. By doing this, we can always reduce time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
(EDIT: Thanks for @billbirdh for pointing out the mistake here. For this problem, by applying the memo, we at most compute for every subproblem once, and there are O(2^n) subproblems, so the complexity is O(2^n) after memorization. (Without memo, time complexity should be like O(n!))

For this question, the key part is: what is the state of the game? Intuitively, to uniquely determine the result of any state, we need to know:

The unchosen numbers
The remaining desiredTotal to reach
A second thought reveals that 1) and 2) are actually related because we can always get the 2) by deducting the sum of chosen numbers from original desiredTotal.

Then the problem becomes how to describe the state using 1).

In my solution, I use a boolean array to denote which numbers have been chosen, and then a question comes to mind, if we want to use a Hashmap to remember the outcome of sub-problems, can we just use Map<boolean[], Boolean> ? Obviously we cannot, because the if we use boolean[] as a key, the reference to boolean[] won't reveal the actual content in boolean[].

Since in the problem statement, it says maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20, which means the length of our boolean[] array will be less than 20. Then we can use an Integer to represent this boolean[] array. How?

Say the boolean[] is {false, false, true, true, false}, then we can transfer it to an Integer with binary representation as 00110. Since Integer is a perfect choice to be the key of HashMap, then we now can "memorize" the sub-problems using Map<Integer, Boolean>.

The rest part of the solution is just simulating the game process using the top-down dp.
