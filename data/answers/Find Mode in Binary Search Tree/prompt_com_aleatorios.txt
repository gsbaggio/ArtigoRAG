CURRENT QUESTION:
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
 

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
Example question 1:
Title: Rotate Image
Categorys: Array Math Matrix
Question text: You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
 

Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
Solution: class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        for(int i=0;i<row; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<=i;j++){
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
            reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        }
    }
};

        INSTRUCTIONS:
        Solve the current question.
        Provide:
        1. A complete and efficient code solution, optimized for both time and space complexity.
        2. A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
           - The intuition behind the approach;
           - Time and space complexity;
           - Important considerations about the algorithm.
        3. If the language has classes, implement in 'Solution' class. Any language is accepted.
        4. You can use the example questions as general references for coding patterns and structure, but solve the current problem independently.
        5. Don't use any external libraries. Don't need to import any libraries.
