# Explanation:
# 1. Intuition:
#    - The algorithm iterates through all possible pairs of points, considering each pair as a diagonal of a potential rectangle.
#    - For each diagonal, it iterates through the remaining points to find a third corner of the rectangle.
#    - Using the properties of a rectangle (equal diagonals, opposite sides parallel and equal), it calculates the coordinates of the fourth corner.
#    - If the fourth corner exists in the set of points and the diagonals are equal, it calculates the area of the rectangle and updates the minimum area found so far.

# 2. Time and Space Complexity:
#    - Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of points. This is because the algorithm iterates through all possible pairs of points (O(n^2)) and then iterates through the remaining points for each pair (O(n)).
#    - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of points. This is because the algorithm stores the points in a set, which takes O(n) space.

# 3. Important Considerations:
#    - The algorithm assumes that all the given points are unique.
#    - The algorithm checks if the diagonals of the potential rectangle are equal in length to ensure that it is a rectangle.
#    - The algorithm uses a set to efficiently check if the fourth corner exists in the set of points.
#    - The algorithm initializes the minimum area to infinity to ensure that the first valid area found is always
