CURRENT QUESTION:
Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.

A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) — at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.

Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| ≤ 1 and |y_1 - y_2| ≤ 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.

There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.

To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) — at the intersection of row 2 and column n.

Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of columns.

The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level — the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.

Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe.

Output

For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.

Note

Consider the example from the statement.

In the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) → (2, 2) → (2, 3).

In the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 3) → (2, 4).

In the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1, 1) → (2, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 4) → (1, 5) → (2, 6).

Example question 1:
Name: 1180_A. Alex and a Rhombus
Tags: ['dp', 'implementation', 'math']
Description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Example question 2:
Name: 1400_A. String Similarity
Tags: ['constructive algorithms', 'strings']
Description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01.
