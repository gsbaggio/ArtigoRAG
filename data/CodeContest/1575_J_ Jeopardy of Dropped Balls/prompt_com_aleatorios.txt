CURRENT QUESTION:
Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n × m

Each cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.

  * a_{x,y}=1 — the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1)); 
  * a_{x,y}=2 — the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y)); 
  * a_{x,y}=3 — the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). 



Every time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m) columns.

Determine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.

The i-th of the next n lines contains m integers a_{i,1},a_{i,2},…,a_{i,m} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 3). It will satisfy a_{i, 1} ≠ 3 and a_{i, m} ≠ 1.

The next line contains k integers c_1, c_2, …, c_k (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m) — the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.

Output

Output k integers — the i-th integer denoting the column where the i-th ball will end.

Examples

Input


5 5 3
1 2 3 3 3
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2

1 2 1


Output


2 2 1

Output


1 2 

Note

In the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1, 1) will change direction to the bottom direction.

<image>

The second and third balls will drop as follows. 

<image>

All balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c_1, c_2, ..., c_k-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.

Example question 1:

Description: Problem description
It is winter super sale and all the shops have various offers. Suraj selected N items to buy and he is standing in the billing queue. It was then he noticed the offer "Buy two, get two". That means for every two items you buy, they give you two items for free. However, items can be of varying price, they always charge for 2 most costly items and give other 2 as free. For example, if the items cost 1, 1, 2, 2, then you have to pay 4 and take all 4 items.
Suraj is busy reordering his items to reduce the total price he has to pay. He can separate the items and get them on different bills if needed. Can you tell me what is the least price Suraj has to pay to buy all the N items?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case has single integer N. Second line of each test case has N space separated integers, which are the costs of items Suraj want to buy.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the required answer.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ Cost of items ≤ 1000


Example
Input:
3
4
1 1 2 2
2
10 200
7
1 1 10 2 2 2 1

Output:
4
210
14

Explanation
Example case 1
Suraj pays for 2 costly items and gets other 2 for free.
Example case 2
Suraj has to pay for both the items, he wont get anything for free.
Example case 3
Suraj separates the items into 2 bills. In one bill he pays 12. And in another bill he pays 2.
