CURRENT QUESTION:
You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. You have to choose a positive integer d and paint all elements into two colors. All elements which are divisible by d will be painted red, and all other elements will be painted blue.

The coloring is called beautiful if there are no pairs of adjacent elements with the same color in the array. Your task is to find any value of d which yields a beautiful coloring, or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements of the array.

The second line of each testcase contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{18}).

Output

For each testcase print a single integer. If there is no such value of d that yields a beautiful coloring, print 0. Otherwise, print any suitable value of d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^{18}).

Example question 1:
Name: 61_A. Ultra-Fast Mathematician
Tags: ['implementation']
Description: Shapur was an extremely gifted student. He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second.

One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.

In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The i-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the i-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the i-th digit of the answer is 0.

Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.

Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest. See if you are faster and more accurate.

Input

There are two lines in each input. Each of them contains a single number. It is guaranteed that the numbers are made from 0 and 1 only and that their length is same. The numbers may start with 0. The length of each number doesn't exceed 100.

Output

Write one line — the corresponding answer. Do not omit the leading 0s.
