CURRENT QUESTION:
Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: 1, 4, 8, 9, ....

For a given number n, count the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such x that x is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) — the number of test cases.

Then t lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from 1 to n that Polycarp likes.
