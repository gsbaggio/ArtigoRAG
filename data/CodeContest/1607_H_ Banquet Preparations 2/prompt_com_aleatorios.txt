CURRENT QUESTION:
The chef has cooked n dishes yet again: the i-th dish consists of a_i grams of fish and b_i grams of meat. 

Banquet organizers consider two dishes i and j equal if a_i=a_j and b_i=b_j at the same time.

The banquet organizers estimate the variety of n dishes as follows. The variety of a set of dishes is equal to the number of different dishes in it. The less variety is, the better.

In order to reduce the variety, a taster was invited. He will eat exactly m_i grams of food from each dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he will eat exactly m_i grams of the i-th dish in total.

Determine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of variety is the minimum possible. If there are several correct answers, you may output any of them.

Input

The first line of input data contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next comes a line that contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of dishes. Then follows n lines, i-th of which contains three integers a_i, b_i and m_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6; 0 ≤ m_i ≤ a_i+b_i) — the mass of fish in i-th dish, the mass of meat in i-th dish and how many grams in total the taster should eat in i-th dish.

The sum of all n values for all input data sets in the test does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print on the first line the minimum value of variety that can be achieved by eating exactly m_i grams of food (for all i from 1 to n) from a dish i.

Then print n lines that describe a way to do this: the i-th line should contain two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a_i; 0 ≤ y_i ≤ b_i; x_i+y_i=m_i), where x_i is how many grams of fish the taster should eat from i-th dish, and y_i is how many grams of meat.

If there are several ways to achieve a minimum balance, print any of them.

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
Example question 1:
Name: 279_E. Beautiful Decomposition
Tags: ['dp', 'games', 'greedy', 'number theory']
Description: Valera considers a number beautiful, if it equals 2k or -2k for some integer k (k ≥ 0). Recently, the math teacher asked Valera to represent number n as the sum of beautiful numbers. As Valera is really greedy, he wants to complete the task using as few beautiful numbers as possible. 

Help Valera and find, how many numbers he is going to need. In other words, if you look at all decompositions of the number n into beautiful summands, you need to find the size of the decomposition which has the fewest summands.

Input

The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 106), that is the binary representation of number n without leading zeroes (n > 0).

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum amount of beautiful numbers that give a total of n.

Note

In the first sample n = 2 is a beautiful number.

In the second sample n = 7 and Valera can decompose it into sum 23 + ( - 20).

In the third sample n = 109 can be decomposed into the sum of four summands as follows: 27 + ( - 24) + ( - 22) + 20.
