CURRENT QUESTION:
Denote a cyclic sequence of size n as an array s such that s_n is adjacent to s_1. The segment s[r, l] where l < r is the concatenation of s[r, n] and s[1, l].

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Define b as the cyclic sequence obtained from concatenating m copies of a. Note that b has size n ⋅ m.

You are given an integer k where k = 1 or k is a prime number. Find the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k.

Two segments are considered different if the set of indices of the segments are different. For example, when n = 3 and m = 2, the set of indices for segment s[2, 5] is \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, and for segment s[5, 2] is \{5, 6, 1, 2\}. In particular, the segments s[1, 6], s[2,1], …, s[6, 5] are considered as the same segment.

Output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, k = 1 or k is a prime number).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

Output an integer denoting the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Output


125

Note

In the first example, all valid segments are [1,4], [2, 3], [3, 5], and [4, 2].

In the second example, one of the valid segments is [1, 5].

Example question 1:
Name: 78_C. Beaver Game
Tags: ['dp', 'games', 'number theory']
Description: Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.

There are n logs, each of exactly m meters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) of equal parts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less than k meters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.

Timur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 109).

Output

Print "Timur", if Timur wins, or "Marsel", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes. 

Examples

Input

1 15 4


Output

Timur

Input

4 9 5


Output

Marsel

Note

In the first sample the beavers only have one log, of 15 meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into 3 parts each 5 meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, as k = 4. Thus, the winner is Timur.

In the second example the beavers have 4 logs 9 meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than 5 meters, that's why he loses instantly.
