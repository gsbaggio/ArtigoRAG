CURRENT QUESTION:
You are given N points on an infinite plane with the Cartesian coordinate system on it. N-1 points lay on one line, and one point isn't on that line. You are on point K at the start, and the goal is to visit every point. You can move between any two points in a straight line, and you can revisit points. What is the minimum length of the path? 

Input

The first line contains two integers: N (3 ≤ N ≤ 2*10^5) - the number of points, and K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) - the index of the starting point.

Each of the next N lines contain two integers, A_i, B_i (-10^6 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 10^6) - coordinates of the i-th point.

Output

The output contains one number - the shortest path to visit all given points starting from point K. The absolute difference between your solution and the main solution shouldn't exceed 10^-6;

Example

Input


5 2
0 0
-1 1
2 -2
0 1
-2 2


Output


7.478709

Note

The shortest path consists of these moves: 

2 -> 5 

5 -> 4 

4 -> 1 

1 -> 3 

There isn't any shorter path possible.

Example question 1:
Name: help-the-hungry-grasshopper
Tags: []
Description: Today grasshopper Jimmy Jumper is very hungry and his friend is notorious. Jimmy's friend puts an insect infront of him at a distance d. Jimmy can jump only a finite no of steps in each turn. Jimmy is initially at position 0. He can now jump 1 step to reach position 1 then jump 2 steps to reach position 3 then jump 4 steps to position 7 and so on.

Since Momu is very hungry and could not take risk of jumping but not reaching to the destination point, so you have to tell him whether he can reach to position d or not.

Input: 

First line contains t test cases.
Next t lines contains an integer d.

Constraints:

1 ≤ t ≤ 10

1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9

Output: 

t lines each containing "YES" if he can reach or "NO" if cannot

INSTRUCTIONS:
Solve the current question.
Provide:
1. A complete and efficient code solution, optimized for both time and space complexity.
2. A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
   - The intuition behind the approach;
   - Time and space complexity;
   - Important considerations about the algorithm.
3. You can use the example questions as general references for coding patterns and structure, but solve the current problem independently.
4. Don't use any external libraries. Any language is accepted.
